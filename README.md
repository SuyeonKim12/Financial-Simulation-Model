# Financial-Simulation-Model
- Built a financial simulation model to estimate the potential return and risks of an oil and gas investment, incorporating uncertainty in well production and costs.
- Analyzed investment scenarios using historical drilling costs and future oil price projections to calculate expected returns and downside risk (VaR, CVaR).
- Provided data-driven insights to support decision-making, helping assess financial feasibility and risk exposure for the project.
