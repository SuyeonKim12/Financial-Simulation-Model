# Financial-Simulation-Model
- Built a financial simulation model to estimate the potential return and risks of an oil and gas investment, incorporating uncertainty in well production and costs.
- Analyzed investment scenarios using historical drilling costs and future oil price projections to calculate expected returns and downside risk (VaR, CVaR).
- Performed NPV (Net Present Value) analysis to evaluate the financial viability of the project, integrating cash flow projections and discount rate considerations.
